# HR-Analytics---Predict-Employee-Attrition
Objective: Use analytics to understand the main causes of employee resignation and predict future  attrition.  Tools: Python (Pandas, Seaborn), Power BI, Sklearn
# 📘 Employee Attrition Prediction & Prevention Suggestions
##📝 Abstract
Employee attrition affects productivity, team morale, and operational costs. This project applies machine learning techniques—specifically a Decision Tree Classifier—to predict employee attrition. Using SHAP for explainability and Power BI for visualization, the goal is to uncover key drivers of attrition and recommend data-backed strategies for employee retention.

## 📌 Introduction
In competitive business environments, retaining skilled employees is a major concern. High turnover leads to financial and operational strain. This project focuses on:

Building a predictive model for attrition

Understanding contributing factors

Delivering actionable retention strategies

Visualizing insights using Power BI

## 🧰 Tools Used
Python: Main language for data processing and model development

Pandas, NumPy: Data preprocessing and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizations for EDA

Scikit-learn: Decision Tree Classifier

SHAP: Model explainability and feature importance

Power BI: Dashboard for interactive HR analytics

Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

## 🔄 Steps Involved
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Loaded HR dataset with attributes like age, job role, department, salary, and attrition status

Cleaned data and encoded categorical variables

Created derived features like Salary Band for deeper analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized attrition trends across:

Departments

Job Roles

Salary Bands

## ✅ Attrition Prevention Suggestions
Area	Suggestion
💰 Compensation	Regular reviews for fair pay across salary bands
🚀 Career Growth	Clear paths for promotion and training
🧠 Work Environment	Leadership training in high-turnover departments
💬 Employee Engagement	Feedback, recognition, and inclusion programs
🧘‍♂️ Work-Life Balance	Hybrid/remote work options, wellness initiatives

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project successfully implemented a machine learning model to predict employee attrition. SHAP analysis provided insight into key drivers of turnover, while Power BI helped visualize these findings. The combined approach empowers HR teams with predictive insights and tailored strategies to improve retention.
